            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian comfort dish made by layering 
                wide pasta sheets with a rich tomato sauce, creamy ricotta, gooey mozzarella, and 
                savory ground beef or sausage. The base starts with a flavorful meat sauce simmered with onions, 
                garlic, and herbs, then spread between layers of cooked pasta and cheese. Each layer builds flavor and 
                texture, creating a hearty and satisfying bake.</p>
            <p>Once the layers are assembled, the dish is baked until the top turns golden and bubbly, 
                with melted cheese stretching over each slice. Resting the lasagna before cutting allows the 
                layers to set, making it easier to serve. The result is a warm, filling meal perfect for family 
                dinners, gatherings, or simply enjoying leftovers the next day.</p>
