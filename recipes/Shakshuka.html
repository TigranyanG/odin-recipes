        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Shakshuka is a North African and Middle Eastern dish of eggs poached in a rich 
            tomato sauce with spices. It's warm, comforting, and often served for breakfast, though 
            it works just as well for lunch or dinner. The combination of spices and runny yolks makes 
            it hearty yet simple.</p>
        <p>It's traditionally eaten with bread for dipping, and the sauce can be adjusted
            with chili for heat or herbs for freshness. It's a one-pan dish, making it easy
            to prepare and clean up.</p>
